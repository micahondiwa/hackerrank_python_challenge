 [0x00-say_hello.py](0x00-say_hello.py)  | Say "Hello, World!" with python.     |
| [0x01-if_else.py](0x01-if_else.py)                       | Given an integer, n , perform the following conditional actions: If n is odd, print `Weird`. If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print `Not Weird`. If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print `Weird`. If n is even and greater than 20, print `Not Weird`. Input Format - A single line containing a positive integer, n. Constraints: 1 <= 1 n <= 100. Print `Weird` if the number is `weird`. Otherwise, print `Not Weird`.|
|[0x02-arithmetic_operations](0x02-arithmetic_operations) | Given numbers a and b: The first line contains the sum of the two numbers. The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).The third line contains the product of the two number.|
| [0x03-division.py](0x03-division.py)| Given two integers a, and b. Add logic to print two lines. The first line should contain the result of integer division, a // b . The second line should contain the result of float division, a / b .|
|[0x04-loops.py](0x04-loops.py) | The provided code stub reads and integer, `n`, from STDIN. For all non-negative integers `i < n` , print `i^2`.|
